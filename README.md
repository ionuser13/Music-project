# Music project
This is a gallery that contains the songs of my Spotify playlist.
## Description 
This project was born from the idea that we should build personal projects in order to improve our professional skills. It is one of my first projects, back when I was learning the HTML basics. At first, it was a folder with some files barely connected between them, each one with information of a song from my playlist. Then I came up with a principal page: a gallery where each item redirected to the song's page. Everything was planed to be done manually: the items in the gallery and each song page. Plans changed after finishing the Asynchronism with JS course in Platzi and learning asynchronism and the basics of connecting to APIs. Instead of creating every item and song page manually, the items will be created with a template, replacing the default infor with the data from the API. For now, there won't be individual pages for each song. Instead, every item on the gallery will redirect to the son's Genius page. This was possible with Regular expressions and template literals. The technologies used in this projetc were HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.,
